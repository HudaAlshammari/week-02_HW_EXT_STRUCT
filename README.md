# week-02_HW_EXT_STRUCT

## Your duty is to model a phoneBook . The first step is to model a Person entry . Follow those steps :
- create a struct Person
- Person has the following properties :
- - firstName : String
- - middleName : String
- - lastName : String
- - mobileNumber : String
- - age : Int
- - address : String

### Now , we want to extend the functionality of this new struct. Use extension to add the following method  :
- func describePerson ()
- This new function, should print a description of the person . Example : "person: Dana Salim AlZain. Her mobile phone number is: +966 564 93849. She is 27 years old. Dana adress is  22nd street, Building 20846"

### Lastly, create 3 different persons. For each of them call the function describePerson()
